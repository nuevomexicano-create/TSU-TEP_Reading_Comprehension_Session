<h2>The 5 Reading Strategies</h2>

<div class="strategy-box">
  <p><span class="num">1. SKIMMING</span> — Get the main idea quickly (30–60 seconds)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read: title → first sentence of each paragraph → last sentence</li>
    <li>Use for: "What is this text <strong>mainly about</strong>?" / "What is the <strong>purpose</strong>?"</li>
    <li>Do NOT read every word — move fast</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="strategy-box">
  <p><span class="num">2. SCANNING</span> — Find specific information fast</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read the question → pick the key word → search the passage for it</li>
    <li>When you find it, <strong>stop and read that sentence carefully</strong></li>
    <li>Use for: questions with numbers, names, prices, or dates</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="strategy-box">
  <p><span class="num">3. VOCABULARY IN CONTEXT</span> — Guess word meaning from clues</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read the sentence before AND after the unknown word</li>
    <li>Look for: definition, synonym, antonym, or logical clue</li>
    <li>Use for: "The word <em>X</em> is closest in meaning to…"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="strategy-box">
  <p><span class="num">4. READING FOR DETAIL</span> — Find an exact fact (slow and careful)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scan to find the location → read that section + the sentences around it</li>
    <li>The answer is in the text — don't use outside knowledge</li>
    <li>Use for: "Which is TRUE?" / "Which is NOT mentioned?" / "According to the passage…"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="strategy-box">
  <p><span class="num">5. MAKING INFERENCES</span> — Read between the lines</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The answer is <strong>not stated</strong> — it is <em>suggested</em> by the text</li>
    <li>The correct answer must still be supported by something in the passage</li>
    <li>Use for: "It can be <strong>inferred</strong>…" / "The author <strong>implies</strong>…"</li>
  </ul>

<div class="passage">
  <strong>THE HONEY BEE — MORE THAN JUST HONEY</strong><br><br>
  The honey bee is one of the most important insects on Earth. Although many people associate bees mainly with honey, their role as pollinators is far more significant. As bees travel from flower to flower collecting nectar, they transfer pollen, which allows plants to reproduce. Scientists estimate that bees are responsible for pollinating approximately one third of all the food that humans consume, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts.<br><br>
  A single honey bee colony may contain up to 60,000 individual bees, all working together with remarkable efficiency. Each colony is led by a queen, whose only purpose is to lay eggs. Worker bees, which are all female, are responsible for collecting food, building and maintaining the hive, and defending the colony against threats. Male bees, known as drones, exist for just one purpose — to mate with a new queen.<br><br>
  In recent decades, bee populations worldwide have been declining at a worrying rate. A condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder has caused worker bees to disappear suddenly from their hives, leaving behind a queen and food stores but no workers. Researchers believe that the widespread use of pesticides, loss of natural habitats, and the spread of disease are all contributing to this problem.<br><br>
  The consequences of losing bees could be severe. Without bees to pollinate crops, food production would fall considerably and prices for many everyday foods would rise. Governments and conservation organisations are encouraging people to plant bee-friendly flowers, reduce their use of chemical pesticides, and support local beekeepers. Protecting bees ultimately means protecting our own food supply.
